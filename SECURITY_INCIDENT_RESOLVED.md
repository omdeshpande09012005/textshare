## üö® CRITICAL ACTIONS YOU MUST DO NOW

### Step 1: REVOKE THE EXPOSED API KEY (DO THIS FIRST!)
1. Go to your Resend Dashboard: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Find the key: `re_7Mn8UmfX_FHJzakYHswvRvshokM1rs4z6`
3. Click "Delete" or "Revoke" button
4. **IMPORTANT:** Anyone with this key can send emails on your behalf!

### Step 2: Create a NEW API Key
1. In Resend Dashboard, click "Create API Key"
2. Give it a name: "TextShare Production"
3. Copy the NEW key (starts with `re_...`)
4. Store it securely (use a password manager!)

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your TextShare project
3. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Find `RESEND_API_KEY`
5. Click "Edit" and paste your NEW key
6. Click "Save"
7. **Redeploy** your application for changes to take effect

### Step 4: Update Local Environment
1. Open: `w:\PROJECTS\textshare\.env.local`
2. Replace: `RESEND_API_KEY="YOUR_NEW_RESEND_API_KEY_HERE"`
3. With: `RESEND_API_KEY="your_actual_new_key_here"`
4. Save the file
5. **DO NOT commit this file to Git!** (it's already in .gitignore)

### Step 5: Monitor for Unauthorized Usage
1. Check Resend Dashboard for any suspicious email activity
2. Review recent sends: https://resend.com/emails
3. If you see unauthorized emails, contact Resend support immediately

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. .gitignore Protection
```ignore
# env files (can opt-in for committing if needed)
.env*
```
‚úÖ All `.env` files are now ignored by Git

### 2. deploy.ps1 Updated
- ‚ùå OLD: `RESEND_API_KEY (already have: re_7Mn8UmfX_FHJzakYHswvRvshokM1rs4z6)`
- ‚úÖ NEW: `RESEND_API_KEY (get from Resend.com dashboard)`

### 3. .env.local Template
- Uses placeholder: `YOUR_NEW_RESEND_API_KEY_HERE`
- Includes comments with instructions

---

## üìã SECURITY BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Always use environment variables** for sensitive data
2. **Keep .env files in .gitignore**
3. **Use .env.example** for templates (with fake values)
4. **Rotate API keys** regularly (every 3-6 months)
5. **Use different keys** for development and production
6. **Enable 2FA** on all service accounts
7. **Review commits** before pushing to GitHub

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. **Never hardcode** API keys in source code
2. **Don't commit** .env files to version control
3. **Don't share** API keys via chat/email
4. **Don't reuse** API keys across multiple projects
5. **Don't ignore** security alerts from GitGuardian/GitHub
